Some code was taken from Ole Arndt's package: http://github.com/anwyn/planetwars, which is under Mit licence

1. Write your bot instead of random one in "MyBot.lisp".

2. Build an executable: simply run "make MyBot"

3. Test it locally against one of the example bots: "./run-match DualBot 7" (or any other bot in example_bots and any other map number)

4. Server is not able now to run lisp code, watch messages at the forum.

5. Instead of it you can use an alternative server: 72.44.46.68
